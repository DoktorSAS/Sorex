# Black ops II Trickshot Servers

# Trickshot Azza Servers
##### What are Azza servers and what does Azza mean?
**Azza** *servers are nothing but servers where you can try* **any kind of trickshot without any limits**. *This means that in Azza servers* **I can add all the things that normally are not possible to do**, such as **sliders** and **RPG Ride**. I chose to call them **Azza** for the **Loz Azza menu**. *Everyone used this menu to try trickshot in private match. Azza does* **not want** to imply that you can use **cheat** or **Explosive Bullets**. In fact whoever is or will **be caught using** cheat **will be banned permanently** *by the servers. The servers have been created* **to allow players to make more trickshots** *and it is not necessary to use cheats. The servers have* **18 places for players**, *hitting on an 18 server is much easier than hitting on an 8 server*.

# S&D Trickshot Server

**S&D** *servers were made to bring the community back to the* **old days**, back to when the "6 man lobby" to go trickshot. They are **very simple** but very **interesting** servers. In fact on the server the **bomb is planted and defused automatically**. *If time is running out, the bomb will be placed, if you take a trickshot and the bomb must be defused, the server will* **automatically** defuse it.
