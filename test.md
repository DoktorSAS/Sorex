# Hosting Servers
Sorex Studios is pleased to present the new Hosting Servers service. By donating a certain amount of money, you can have your own server. You can have servers with or without mods and you can also get servers for Black ops II Zombies and Multiplayer. 

We can provide this service through the use of our dedicated servers. It will not be possible to get a server for free as there are costs to maintain it.

### Important
The service we provide is a service provided as a **`Hobby`**. We own virtual machines that we don't use for anything, and we want to use them to entertain the players. The money we get from this service is only to **`keep the costs`** of our virtual machines down.


# Black ops II 
Both Multiplayer and Zombies servers are available on Black ops II.  Multplayer servers will be hosted in Germany and Zombies servers in France. To get a private server for zombies you need to contact **`Williampilote#6631`** and for Multiplayer servers **`DoktorSAS#1141`**.

### Zombies

The zombies servers are run by **`Williampilote#6631`** , but the mods are developed by  **`DoktorSAS#1141`**. This means that to request a server you only need to talk to **`Williampilote#6631`** , but if you want features in addition to the server you need to talk to **`Williampilote#6631`** and  **`DoktorSAS#1141`**.

#### Prices
Prices are decided according to the available features, you can pay less to get things you don't want. The system allows you to choose to have or not to have one of the features in the list. 
The list tells you what you have access to but you can also ask to deactivate a certain feature.
