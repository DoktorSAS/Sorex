# julia
I am julia, a 19-year-old girl with a passion for gaming & reverse engineering.
I also do programming, though i wouldn't say i can do anything noteworthy.
I am learning C++ at the moment, but my prior experiences are GSC, C, and C#.

The only "special" thing i can say i've accomplished is reversing the fast file asset & make a zone tool to compile fastfiles for MW2 Alpha, along with patching the game to load unofficial fastfiles of course.
