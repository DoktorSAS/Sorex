I am DoktorSAS a 20-year-old boy who has a passion for programming. I can program in many programming languages but I am not an expert. I knows the basics of many languages and I use my knowledge to create projects. 
I am the Creator of the Sorex Project, a project dedicated to the community in general. The Sorex Project is a project that not only provides servers to play on, but also provides other useful things.
